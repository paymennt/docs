Extended "Hold Periods" may occur in certain cases, dictated by transaction compliance risks. [<ins>Paymennt.com</ins>](https://www.paymennt.com/) may also utilize [<ins>Reserved Amount</ins>](../getting-started/reserved-account) like Rolling Reserve and Fixed Reserve, tailored to merchant categories and risk levels, guaranteeing funds availability for addressing potential liabilities or contingencies.

Once the fund is settled, the fund will go to your available balance and you can get your fund through <ins>[payouts](./payouts)</ins>.

## Hold Periods

A "hold period" refers to the time during which funds are temporarily held before they are made available to the recipient. This period can be part of the company's risk management or compliance procedures and might be used to:

* **Verify Transactions:** Ensure the legitimacy of the transaction and prevent fraud.
* **Manage Chargebacks:** Allow time to address any disputes or chargeback requests from customers.
* **Ensure Compliance:** Adhere to regulations and anti-money laundering practices.

In Paymennt, we might place a hold on the funds for a few days to confirm that everything is in order before transferring the money to the merchant's account. The length of the hold period can vary depending on factors like transaction size and risk assessment of the transaction.
