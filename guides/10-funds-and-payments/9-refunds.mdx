A refund is the process of returning funds back to the customer. You have the option to make a full or partial refund.

Payments made through [<ins>Paymennt.com</ins>](https://www.paymennt.com/) can be refunded under two conditions:

1. Payment was made less than 90 days before the refund was initiated
2. You have an available balance in your account

:::note Refund To Original Payment Method

To avoid [<ins>chargebacks</ins>](./dispute-chargeback), refunds must be made to the original payment method. If a refund is issued else how, the business would still be subject to the risk of chargebacks.

:::note Refund Processing Time

Refunds are processed and sent to the card network immediately but it may take anywhere between **1 and 5 working days** for the refund to reflect on the card.
