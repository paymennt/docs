Learn about the Reserved Account in **Paymennt**.

A Reserve Account in the context of **Paymennt** refers to a specialized account where funds are held by payment gateways as a form of security or compliance measure. These reserve accounts help ensure the availability of funds to cover potential risks such as chargebacks, refunds, or compliance-related issues. They serve as a safeguard for both the payment gateway and merchants, providing financial stability and protection against unforeseen circumstances.

In [<ins>Paymennt.com</ins>](https://www.paymennt.com/), there are two types of reserve accounts:

1. Rolling Reserve
2. Fixed Reserve

## Reserved - rolling amount

A percentage of your transactions is reserved over a set period, adjusting based on daily transaction volume. For instance, a 5% rolling reserve means 5% of daily transactions are reserved and updated regularly.

A specific, constant amount is reserved, such as $500. This amount remains unchanged regardless of transaction volume.
