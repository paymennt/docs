**Paymennt** offers the flexibility to accept payments in currencies other than your account's settlement currency through Multi-Currency Processing. This allows you to display prices in your customer's native currency, reducing conversion costs and simplifying payments.

Supported currencies include AED, USD, GBP, EUR, and all GCC currencies.

:::note Before You Start

Remember to check if your plan includes multi-currency processing.

:::

If your plan qualifies for multicurrency payments, you can easily change the currency when creating a payment link. Simply select the desired currency from the dropdown menu when entering the payment amount in the payment link request.

## Multi-currency terms and conditionsâ€‹

1. **FX rates are calculated at the time of payment**:
When using Multi-Currency Processing, the conversion rate for each transaction is determined at the time of payment. If you issue a refund, the conversion rate applied will be the rate at the time of the refund, not the original payment. By initiating a payment or refund, you accept the applicable conversion rate.

2. **Supported currencies vary based on account country**:
Supported currencies may vary depending on your account's country, and we reserve the right to adjust the list of supported currencies.
