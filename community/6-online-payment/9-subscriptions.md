## Subscriptions

Paymmnet.com allows you to create subscriptions which customers authorize automatic, periodic payments for your goods or services. Once set up, payments occur at regular intervals, providing a consistent revenue stream for your business.

> Note:
You may need to contact our customer service team to enable the subscription service before you can start using it.

### Create a subscription request

    1- Navigate to the "Earn" section in the side menu, then select "Subscriptions" from the submenu.
    2- On the “Subscriptions” page, you can see the active subscription records on the “Active” tab and the stopped subscription records on the “Stopped” tab.
    3- To start a new subscription request, you can tap the “+” on the top right corner
    4- You can select either an amount, some products, or some event tickets for the payment request
    5- You would need to name the subscription (such as “Monthly subscription to gym membership”) and input the subscription settings
    6- Finally, you can select customer(s) to share the subscription request with. 

After creating a subscription request, the payment invoice will be sent to the selected customer by email. Payment will be collected from the customer subsequently according to the billing cycle.

### Manage a subscription request

You can always “Pause” or “Archive” a subscription
    1- Navigate to the "Earn" section in the side menu, then select "Subscriptions" from the submenu.
    2- Tap the subscription record you would like to manage
    3- On the subscription record details page, you can find the “Pause” and “Archive” buttons at the bottom

**Pause**

    When you need to temporarily halt a subscription, you can use the "Pause" feature. This action stops payment collection while keeping the record visible on the subscription list. However, the subscription end date remains unchanged, and to resume payment collection, you'll need to manually resume the subscription.

**Archive**

    Alternatively, if you no longer require a subscription, you can choose to "Archive" it. This action moves the record to an "Archive list," ceasing payment collection while maintaining the subscription end date. To reactivate or resume payment collection for an archived subscription, manual intervention is necessary by accessing the Archive list.
