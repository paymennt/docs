Paymennt offers the flexibility to accept payments in currencies other than your account's settlement currency through Multi-Currency Processing. This allows you to display prices in your customer's native currency, reducing conversion costs and simplifying payments.

Supported currencies include AED, USD, GBP, EUR, and all GCC currencies.

BEFORE YOU START
Remember to check if your plan includes multi-currency processing

If your plan qualifies for multicurrency payments, you can easily change the currency when creating a payment link. Simply select the desired currency from the dropdown menu when entering the payment amount in the payment link request.

## Multi-currency terms and conditions​

1. **FX rates are calculated at the time of payment**

When using Multi-Currency Processing, the conversion rate for each transaction is determined at the time of payment. If you issue a refund, the conversion rate applied will be the rate at the time of the refund, not the original payment. By initiating a payment or refund, you accept the applicable conversion rate.
2. **Supported currencies vary based on account country**

Supported currencies may vary depending on your account's country, and we reserve the right to adjust the list of supported currencies.
