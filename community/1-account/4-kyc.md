Learn about the KYC process in Paymennt.

## What is KYC?

Know Your Customer (KYC) refers to the process of a financial service provider, such as a bank or a payment service provide like us, verifying the identity of its clients. This is a key component of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations, which are designed to combat financial crimes.
