Learn about the Reserved Account in Paymennt

A Reserve Account in the context of payments refers to a specialized account where funds are held by payment gateways as a form of security or compliance measure. These reserve accounts help ensure the availability of funds to cover potential risks such as chargebacks, refunds, or compliance-related issues. They serve as a safeguard for both the payment gateway and merchants, providing financial stability and protection against unforeseen circumstances.
In Paymennt.com, there are two types of reserve accounts: 1. Rolling Reserve and 2. Fixed Reserve.

## Reserved - rolling amount

A percentage of your transactions is reserved over a set period, adjusting based on daily transaction volume. For instance, a 5% rolling reserve means 5% of daily transactions are reserved and updated regularly.

## Reserved - fixed amount

A specific, constant amount is reserved, such as $500. This amount remains unchanged regardless of transaction volume.

:::note

Reserved amounts will be assigned or adjusted by the compliance team based on your risk level whenever necessary. For more information or assistance, please contact our support team.
