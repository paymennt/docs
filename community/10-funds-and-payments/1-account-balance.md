There are two main ways to access your account balance:

1. **From the Landing Page:** Simply click on the "Available Balance" link to view your account balance summary.
2. **From the Finance Section:** On the side menu, navigate to "Finance" (Under "Account") -> "Account Balance." This will give you a detailed view of your account balance.

## Understanding Account Balance Components

On the account balance page, you will see a breakdown of your transactions, including:

* **Processing Amount:** The total amount from transactions that are currently being processed.
* **Payout Amount:** The amount that has been paid out to your bank or payment card.
* **On-Hold Balance:** The total amount from transactions that are on hold.
* **Reserved - rolling/ Reserved - fixed Amount:** The amount that is reserved by Paymennt until reaching the reserved limit. For more information, please refer to the <ins>[Reserved Amount](/community/1-account/5-reserved-account.md)</ins> page
* **Outstanding Amount:** The negative balance due to unpaid plan fee or other Paymennt service fee

## Total Balance vs. Available Balance

* **Total Balance:** This is the sum of all transactions, including those in processing, on hold, in reserved and minus any outstanding amount.
* **Available Balance:** This is your "Total Balance" minus any on-hold/ in process/ reserved amount. It represents the funds that are currently accessible for withdrawal/ payouts.

## Accessing Your Transaction History

To view your transaction history, go to the "Account Balance" page and select the specific date range you're interested in. You can review each transaction's details, including status, amount, and payment method.
