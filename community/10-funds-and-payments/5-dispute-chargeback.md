## Dispute (Chargeback)

Disputes, also known as chargebacks, can arise in payment transactions due to various reasons such as unauthorized charges, errors, or dissatisfaction with goods/services. When a customer disputes a charge with their bank or card issuer, it can lead to a chargeback, resulting in the reversal of the transaction and the amount being charged back to the merchant.

Chargebacks can occur for several reasons, including customer disputes, unauthorized transactions, non-compliance with payment network rules, or suspicious activity. Merchants are immediately liable to Paymennt.com for the full amount of the chargeback, along with any associated fees, fines, or penalties.

If funds related to a chargeback cannot be recovered, the merchant is obligated to reimburse the payment processor promptly. Additionally, if there's a likelihood of a chargeback, Payment.com may withhold funds from the merchant's payments until the dispute is resolved, expired, or determined not to result in a chargeback.
